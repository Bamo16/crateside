# crateside design rules

What is built, for the next design session to start from. **Update this file in the same commit
as any change to tokens, chips, header shapes or table caps.** The code wins where the two differ.

Everything else in this folder is frozen history from the Claude Design sessions: `canvases/`
(open a `.dc.html` in a browser with `support.js` beside it), `handoffs/`, `briefs/` and
`brand/`. [ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md) indexes them.

## Palette

Defined once in `src/Crateside/wwwroot/app.css`. One warm dark palette:

| token | value | use |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#141310` | page |
| `--surface` | `#1b1a15` | boxes, bands |
| `--raised` | `#23211a` | buttons, inputs |
| `--ink` | `#0f0e0c` | text on a filled chip or badge, never a background |
| `--text` | `#ece7dc` | text |

Text tiers are alpha over `--text`: `--text-75`, `-60`, `-50` for prose; `-40`, `-35`, `-30` for
labels and decoration only, never a sentence.

## Colour means state, and nothing else is coloured

- **Teal**: the machine is working.
- **Amber**: it is the user's turn.
- **Red**: needs attention.
- **Green**: done, and only ever done.

A thing that is none of these is monochrome. The evidence's source-kind badges are the example:
filled for authoritative, outlined for corroborating, dashed for algorithmic and chords-only.

## Type

IBM Plex Sans for text. IBM Plex Mono for every number, key, timestamp and count.

## State chips

One component, `Components/StateChip.razor`, used wherever a track's state is shown. Styles:
neutral outline · teal filled with a dot · teal outline · amber filled · red outline · red filled
· green outline · dashed.

## Page headers

`PageHeader` has three shapes, a closed set: **Bar**, **Flush**, **Shade**. A new page picks one.

| page | shape |
|---|---|
| Tracks | Shade |
| Track details | Bar, Tracks tab active |
| Library | Bar |
| Partners | Bar |
| Settings | Flush |

## Table caps

One width cap per table shape: `--table-partners` 50rem, `--table-library` 56rem,
`--table-tracks` 92rem. Track details uses `--table-tracks`.
